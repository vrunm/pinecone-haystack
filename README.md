# Pinecone Document Store

This Github repository is a template that can be used to create custom document stores to extend
the new [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/) API available under the `preview`
package starting from version 1.15.

While the new API is still under active development, the new "Store" architecture is quite stable
and we are encouraging early adopters to contribute their custom document stores.
